Adds the ETag, Last-Modified, Expires and Cache-Control headers to HTTP responses generated by WordPress to facilitate caching.


== Description ==

Adds the *ETag*, *Last-Modified*, *Expires* and *Cache-Control* headers to HTTP responses generated by WordPress to facilitate caching.

These HTTP headers are sent to the client when visiting the page of a
post, page, attachment, custom post type, the front page (static pages are supported)
or a page of a category, tag, author or date based archive (pagination is supported).
All feeds (posts feed, comments feed, post comments feed, archive feeds) are supported. 
Search results pages are supported, but no caching is permitted by default.

The value of each header is based on information provided by the post object
in each of the above pages.

In case of archives, the first post is used in order to determine the time
the archive was last modified. Special consideration has been taken so that
ETags are unique, even if a post appears first in more than one archives.

In case of feeds, the *ETag* and the *Last-Modified* headers are generated by
WordPress itself. Add-Headers adds the *Expires* and *Cache-Control* headers to
the feeds.

By default, the expiration date of each page is set to one day (86400 seconds)
after the time the client accessed the resource, but this is configurable
(see *configuration* section).

= Configuration =

The plugin can be configured by filtering the options array. You can add a
filtering function like the following in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function addh_custom_options ( $options ) {
    // These are the default options.
    return array_merge( $options, array(
        'add_etag_header' => true,
        'generate_weak_etag' => false,
        'add_last_modified_header' => true,
        'add_expires_header' => true,
        'add_cache_control_header' => true,
        'cache_max_age_seconds' => 86400,
        'cache_max_age_seconds_for_search_results' => 0,
    ) );
}
add_filter( 'addh_options', 'addh_custom_options', 10, 1 );
`

The settings above demonstrate the default values.

By setting any of the *max-age* settings to `0`, a `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`
header is sent. `cache_max_age_seconds_for_search_results` only affects search
results. `cache_max_age_seconds` affects all pages. If you need more customization,
it is possible to filter the headers before they are sent to the client (see *Available Filters* section).
 
The rest of the options should be self-explanatory.

= Available Filters =

The following filters can be used to further customize the HTTP headers.

`addh_options` - applied to the plugin options array. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of options. See the example in the *configuration* section above.
`addh_cache_control_header_format` - applied to the template that is used to generate the `Cache-Control` header's value. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: a string. The default template is "`public, max-age=%s`". The template must have one `%s` placeholder for the max-age seconds.
`addh_headers` - applied to all HTTP headers that have been generated by Add-Headers before they are sent to the client. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of HTTP headers (strings).
`addh_headers_feed` - applied to all HTTP headers that have been generated by Add-Headers for a feed. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of HTTP headers (strings).

= Testing =

You can use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) in order to check the headers.

For example:

`
curl -I -L http://example.org/sample-page/
curl -I -L -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate" http://example.org/sample-page/
curl -I -L -H "If-Modified-Since: Mon, 16 Dec 2013 10:10:00 GMT" http://example.org/sample-page/
curl -I -L -H "If-None-Match: \"abcdefghijklmn\"" http://example.org/sample-page/
